                    Bobcat Messaging Services Overview
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Bobcat Gamesâ€™s email and cross-channel campaign management platforms ingest and consolidate data from a variety of online and mobile sources to build marketing audiences and profiles. We then help our Customers orchestrate data-driven, personalized electronic communications that can be planned or triggered in real time. For example, if you visit a Customer website to buy jeans but leave before making a purchase, you may later receive an email reminding you about the event. As a permission-based marketing service provider we take consumer privacy seriously and offer Customers ways to meet their obligations under applicable privacy laws and marketing regulations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Bobcat Games acts as a data processor at the direction of marketers who purchase our products and services for their use ("Customers"). We do not have a direct relationship with consumers or other message end recipients ("You", "Data Subjects"), as we work in coordination with marketers, agencies and advertisers to help facilitate data-driven marketing. This Privacy Policy describes how we may "Process" various types of Personal Data while providing our Services. "Processing" can mean a variety of operations performed on Personal Data, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction. This Privacy Policy also assists our Customers with their transparency and accountability obligations to Data Subjects.

                    Bobcat Games Processes the following types of Personal Data on behalf of our Customers in accordance with our Services:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Directly identifiable information (also known as personally identifiable information) such as your name, email address, phone number, and postal address, which enable a variety of direct marketing and non-marketing communications
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    De-identified website visitor and email behavioral data (including mobile websites) collected via placement of cookie and cookie-like technology by Bobcat Games or the Customerâ€™s third-party analytics providers to measure the effectiveness of our Customersâ€™ engagements
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Demographic and preference information such as your gender, age, favorite store location, shopping and lifestyle interests, which are used for segmentation and personalization purposes
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Pseudonymous online identifiers such as your IP address, Cookie ID, mobile device identifiers (Apple ID, Google Ad ID), and related technical data about the browser or device which helps bring together the various data points
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Other linked or linkable data which helps Customers create a unified view of their customers and to deliver optimized content using our Services
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Personal Data Collection
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As various laws define personally identifiable information differently, we endeavor to comply with the highest applicable protections applicable to us, notably the EU data protection and privacy laws (e.g. the EU General Data Protection Regulation). We expect our Customers to comply with the respective laws of the location in which personal data is collected for use with our Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We do not intentionally collect or receive, or otherwise Process, personal data that is especially sensitive, but may be asked to do so by select Customers. This includes information that specifically identifies or relates to minors; information which reveals an individual's religious and political affiliations, racial and ethnic origins, sexual preferences and orientation; health related data, biometric and genetic data; information payment card industry data, and credit-worthiness information, among others. If asked to Process such data, we will act in accordance with the heightened data protection and privacy requirements set out under applicable laws, rules, and industry standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    De-Identified Data Collection
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Through the implementation of Bobcat Games pixel tags and similar technologies that our Customers place on their standard and mobile websites, or within email messages, Bobcat places a cookie on your browser, or collects a unique identifier from your mobile device, as directed. The type of information collected through the placement of the pixel may include other commonly associated information from your device or Internet access, such as your IP address, browser type, Operating System (OS), HTTP referrer, event time and event type. These data elements may be unique to the website you recently visited, ad you viewed, or marketing email you interacted with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Cross-Channel and Cross-Device Data Collection
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In order to help our Customers orchestrate the most relevant campaigns possible, Bobcat Games offers email retargeting and email reactivation capabilities. These capabilities help marketers engage website and shopping cart abandoners with timely and relevant incentives, reactivate legacy email subscribers, and target engaged email audiences online with interest-based display, mobile or social ads. When using our Services, Customers are thus able to synchronize personal information with other unique non-personal identifiers, such as cookie, for a variety of marketing and analytics uses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For example, if you click-through an email that Bobcat Games helped facilitate on your smartphone, you may see a similar ad on a standard website or within a social media application, or embedded within a personalized email offer. Please see below for more information on the technologies driving these capabilities and your choices for continued tracking.

                    Grounds for Using Your Personal Data
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When providing access to our platforms and delivering Services, Bobcat Games acts a Data Processor and relies on the following lawful grounds to Process Personal Data:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Legitimate business interests. We may use Personal Data for our legitimate business interests to administer our platforms, ensure the integrity of our transmission network, and to enforce our Acceptable Use Policy
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Data Subject Consent. To the extent Customers need to collect and share, or allow us to facilitate collection and sharing of Personal Data to enable our Services, it is the responsibility of Customers to provide necessary privacy notices and obtain required consent(s).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Data Management and Integration Technology
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Bobcat Games Services enable our Customers to collect, manage and integrate a variety of data from the digital properties they own, the web pages and forms we may host on their behalf, and from third party partners Customers may choose to work with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Our technology empowers marketers to collect and integrate data from outside sources through multiple points of entry, including API calls, webforms, manual uploads and secure file transfers, among others. Available data ingestion methods include batch import and HTTP posting, complemented by standard, sequential and advanced data loading capabilities. As such, Customer databases (and recipient profiles) are frequently updated with new personal and non-personal information. Bobcat Games has no means to independently embed our forms and technologies into Customersâ€™ digital properties without their direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We use commercially reasonable means to secure these data points of entry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    APIs we offer our Customers
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Bobcat Games offers our Customers a variety of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to simplify or automate how they use the platform for a variety of processing activities. For example, our Advanced Data Load Endpoint allows a single API request to load data into multiple joint tables simultaneously, rather than sequentially.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Personal and non-personal information submission: Customers may use APIs to submit records containing personal and associated data (as described above) into their marketing databases. Our APIs accommodate a number of industry standard web communication channels and data loading techniques, including via HTTP-based webform submissions, batch data imports and sequential data loading services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    API endpoint security: Data we collect on behalf of our Customers through API endpoints is secured through commercially reasonable technical and administrative means. Generally, our API endpoints are built in a manner that imposes a set of constraints on how data may be submitted to the system. For example, if you wish to submit personal data via a URL, you would specify for the connection to be secured using SSL encryption and the data transmitted over HTTPS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Endpoints that support JSON and XML data objects are secured using a two-step security validation process. We use an industry standard protocol to authenticate requests to access available services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We then validate whether the requestor has the proper rights and privileges to the service being requested. Unauthorized users will be denied the ability to submit data using such endpoints.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Web pages and forms we host for our Customers
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Bobcat Games provides web page hosting for our Customersâ€™ for their convenience. Hosted services facilitate email subscription, preference management, refer-a-friend, sweepstakes, and on-demand content fulfillment information (e.g. coupons and real-time offers). Our privacy and security practices with respect to these hosted pages are:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Personal data collection and use
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When hosting forms and providing data collection tools to our Customers Bobcat Games acts as a 'pipe' and underlying technology provider allowing Customers to load personal data directly into their Bobcat Games marketing databases. As data processor, the personal data that we collect on behalf of our Customers is the exclusive property of the Customer that is branded on the web page. Web pages we host on the Customer's behalf will include links to their website and privacy notices providing information on the Customerâ€™s privacy and data security practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A special note about Refer-a-Friend (RAF) services: We offer our Customers the ability for recipients to use a web form we host on their behalf to forward an email message to another recipient. Referrals of this nature are sent similarly to any other commercial message a Customer would send through our Services with all of the applicable tracking technology referenced above.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In accordance with international privacy laws and business policy, we collect referral email addresses only to process the message transaction. Neither we nor our Customers may use the referral email address for any purpose other than to execute the requested email transmission on behalf of the forwarder. Since email forwarding may be restricted by law or otherwise impractical in some jurisdictions, Customers are responsible for ensuring compliance wherever this service is offered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In special circumstances, we may host this transmission request for a specified period of time in order to monitor delivery or deliver subsequently requested email referrals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If you believe that an email sent through a RAF web page we host was sent to you incorrectly, please email us with the message in question and its full transmission header.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    De-identified and non-personal data collection and use: Web pages we host may include use of all of the de-identified, pseudonymous and non-personal information collection technologies described above.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Hosted web page security: Data we collect on behalf of our Customers is held in a secure environment, with restricted user access, and managed by a team of experienced system administrators. The pages we host on our Customersâ€™ behalf are encrypted with SSL and certified by a third party security provider, Once we collect information through a hosted web page on our Customers' behalf, the Customers will have immediate access to this data for their own purposes. While we maintain privacy and data security processes for information we host through our Services, we are not responsible for such practices for information hosted by our Customers. If you have questions or concerns about our Customers' privacy practices or representations, please communicate directly with the Customer.

                    <p>
                    As part of our Services we may set cookies associated with pixel tags for (i) web pages we develop and host on behalf of Customers, or (ii) where authorized by a Customer within their email messages and on their own websites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Cookies may be downloaded from our web servers and stored locally on an email recipient's computer. Information on the cookie is then referenced by the web browser in conjunction with specific web-enabled email or visited web pages. This cookie responds to a web server with information about how the email recipient engaged with the email or web pages (i.e., open, click-through, image download, etc). An example of this occurs when Customers track email users' visits to a website and any subsequent online sales that could be correlated with the email recipient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In addition to engagement tracking, our cookies enable our Customers to provide website and email personalization services for their email subscribers, customers, or registered website visitors. This requires us to connect email and website visitor activity with previously provided information in order to offer personalization, web form pre-population and closer relevance of our Customers' email marketing efforts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The cookies we attempt to set do not contain any directly identifiable personal data such as name or email address in the cookie itself, but pseudonymous identifiers such as a cookie ID may be utilized for performance tracking purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The cookies that Bobcat Games sets are configured to expire, generally after 7 days, but the expiration period can be longer. Bobcat Games cookies are re-authenticated for incremental 7-day, or greater, periods when a Customer's customer opens an email or clicks through an email to a URL embedded into the email. Otherwise, they expire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    How you can control email-related cookies:

                    <p>
                    All Internet browsers can be set to notify you before you receive a cookie and give you control over whether or not you choose to accept any particular cookies. You have the option of setting your browser to turn off cookies or restrict cookie delivery to particular websites.

                    Email-related pixel tags (aka web beacons)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A pixel tag is an invisible image with a line of code, also called a clear gif, which is placed within an email message in the same way as on a web page. The reasons for use of a pixel tag in an HTML email message include:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    To sense whether an email recipient can receive html email or only receive text email.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    To detect whether the email recipient has opened the message, and whether that email message was opened successive times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    To help activate a cookie and integrate web activity with email activity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Please note that pixel tags do not create, modify or delete files on a user's machine. They are not executable and cannot be used to deliver dangerous content, such as a virus. Rather, pixel tags help our Customers identify particular email recipients, who can then be sent more relevant email content in the future.

                    Message 'click-through' monitoring
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Nearly every email sent through our systems includes a hyperlink to another website. Our Customers have the ability to track whether that hyperlink has been clicked on and whether that link was clicked on successive times. Customers can then determine the success of their email campaigns and tailor future messaging to recipients based on the relevancy of that 'click-through' activity. When links are clicked on, additional pixel tags attempt to activate cookies to help measure the effectiveness of the email campaign.
                    </p>

                    User-initiated message forwarding
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We may also collect anonymous tracking information with email messages 'forwarded' from a recipient within their own email software or webmail service to another user. Examples of information collected may include the number of times the message was forwarded, the number of times the forwarded message was opened, and the click-through activity within those forwarded messages. No identifiable personal data concerning a natural personal is collected with email messages forwarded by a recipient through this process.
